# Bismuth
Getting down to Bismuth with React, Vite & Typescript. Vite gives us Hot Module Reloading (HMR) so we can work with React & TypeScript in realtime.

Made for [Curious Byte](https://www.youtube.com/@CuriousByte) but is ideal for anybody wanting a good starter project with all the basics.

### Getting started
npm
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
yarn
```
yarn install
yarn dev
```
pnpm
```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
